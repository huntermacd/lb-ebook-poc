Know where you are before you try and figure out where you’re going. A content inventory can tell you how much content you are dealing with, how it’s organized, what it contains, and more. For example, you’ll be able to tell how much you rely on PDFs, if certain pages get no traffic, or if editors are cramming too much content onto a single page.
