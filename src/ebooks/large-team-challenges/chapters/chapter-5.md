Editors often re-upload the same image over and over again, even though
they could have reused one already present in the system. This leads to
resource bloat, and if you have lots of content, it can significantly increase
storage costs. And for those editors who do search for assets before thinking
of uploading their own, it makes it harder for them to find what they are
looking for.

Technology cannot solve the issue of multiple copies of assets. Unless
editors change their habits, implementing the most robust, feature-rich
DAM (Digital Asset Manager) on the planet won’t solve the problem. Assets
still need to be tagged and organized so people can actually find them, and
doing that requires people, not technology.

### SOLUTIONS

- **Training editors**. You can’t get around training editors to search for
assets before uploading new assets. But this also means that they need
training to name and tag assets properly so they can actually be found.
- **Great UX for asset management**. If you are asking for someone to
change their habits, the least you could do is make it as easy as possible.
A great user experience for searching and tagging assets increases the
likelihood of success.
